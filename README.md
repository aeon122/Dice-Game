# Dice-Game1
Description : Create a page that allows the user to play a game with the computer. In this game, the player will roll two dice and the computer will roll two dice. The Math.random() method will be used to generate each roll of a die, from 1 to 6. The sum of the computer’s roll should be compared to the sum of the player’s roll and whoever has the greater sum is the winner of that round. The sum of the winner’s roll for that round should be added to his or her point total. Use functions to call for each roll of two dice and the sum, for keeping track of the points, and to allow the player to continue or quit after a round of play. The following are the game rules: n If one player rolls doubles (i.e., two fours or two sixes, etc.) and is a winner for that round, he or she should get double points.
